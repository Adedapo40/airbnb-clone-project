</br>

## Database Design
### 1. Users
Represents all users of the platform, including hosts and guests.

Key Fields:

* id: Unique identifier for each user

* name: Full name of the user

* email: User's email address (used for login)

* password_hash: Encrypted password for authentication

* is_host: Boolean indicating if the user can list properties

Relationships:

* A user can own multiple properties (if they are a host)

* A user can make multiple bookings

* A user can write multiple reviews
### 2. Properties
Represents the properties listed by hosts.

Key Fields:

* id: Unique identifier for each property

* user_id: References the host (user) who listed the property

* title: Title of the property listing

* description: Detailed information about the property

* location: Address or general location of the property

Relationships:

* A property belongs to a single user (host)

* A property can have multiple bookings

* A property can have multiple reviews

### 3. Bookings
Represents reservations made by users for properties.

Key Fields:

* id: Unique identifier for the booking

* user_id: References the guest making the booking

* property_id: References the property being booked

* start_date: Check-in date

* end_date: Check-out date

Relationships:

* A booking belongs to one user (guest)

* A booking belongs to one property

### 4. Reviews
Represents feedback left by guests for properties.

Key Fields:

* id: Unique identifier for the review

* user_id: References the reviewer (guest)

* property_id: References the reviewed property

* rating: Numerical score (e.g., 1–5 stars)

* comment: Text feedback

Relationships:

* A review belongs to one user

* A review belongs to one property

### 5. Payments
Represents payment transactions for bookings.

Key Fields:

* id: Unique identifier for the payment

* booking_id: References the associated booking

* amount: Total amount paid

* payment_method: Type of payment (e.g., credit card, PayPal)

* status: Payment status (e.g., completed, pending, failed)

Relationships:

* A payment is tied to one booking

* A booking has one payment

## Feature Breakdown
### User Management
This feature handles user registration, login, authentication, and profile management. It ensures secure access to the platform and distinguishes between hosts and guests to provide appropriate functionality based on user roles.

### Property Management
Hosts can list, edit, and delete properties, including adding descriptions, prices, photos, and availability. This feature allows the platform to showcase a diverse range of properties to potential guests.

### Booking System
Guests can search for properties, select dates, and make reservations. This system manages availability, prevents double bookings, and maintains a record of current and past reservations.

### Payment Processing
Secure handling of payments using various methods such as credit cards or online wallets. It processes charges at the time of booking and keeps transaction records, ensuring smooth financial operations between guests and hosts.

### Review System
After a stay, guests can leave ratings and feedback on properties. This system builds trust and credibility on the platform, helping users make informed decisions based on others' experiences.

### Data Optimization
Includes database indexing, caching, and efficient querying to ensure fast response times and scalability. This feature is essential for maintaining performance as the number of users, listings, and bookings grows.

## API Security
### Authentication
Description: Implement secure user login using hashed passwords (e.g., bcrypt) and session or token-based authentication (like JWT).
Why It’s Crucial: Protects user accounts from unauthorized access, ensuring only legitimate users can log in and access their data.

### Authorization
Description: Use role-based access control to restrict access to certain actions (e.g., only hosts can list properties, only guests can book).
Why It’s Crucial: Prevents users from performing actions outside their permissions, protecting data integrity and enforcing business rules.

### Rate Limiting
Description: Limit the number of requests a user or IP can make in a given time frame.
Why It’s Crucial: Defends against brute-force attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attempts that could overwhelm the server or expose vulnerabilities.

### Input Validation & Sanitization
Description: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent common attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
Why It’s Crucial: Protects the application from malicious input that could compromise the database or users' browsers.

### Secure Payment Handling
Description: Integrate with trusted third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) and ensure data is encrypted during transmission (HTTPS).
Why It’s Crucial: Secures sensitive financial transactions and helps ensure PCI compliance, building user trust and avoiding legal issues.

### HTTPS Encryption
Description: Use HTTPS to encrypt all data transmitted between clients and the server.
Why It’s Crucial: Protects sensitive information (like passwords and credit card numbers) from being intercepted during transmission.

### Account Protection Features
Description: Include measures like email verification, password reset workflows, and optional two-factor authentication (2FA).
Why It’s Crucial: Helps ensure account security, reduces the risk of credential-based attacks, and improves overall platform trustworthiness.

## CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a set of practices that automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code. In a CI/CD pipeline, every time code is pushed to a repository, automated tests run to check for bugs (CI), and if successful, the code can be automatically deployed to a staging or production environment (CD).

### Why It’s Important for the Project
CI/CD pipelines help ensure that new features and fixes can be delivered quickly and reliably without breaking existing functionality. For an Airbnb clone, this means faster development cycles, fewer bugs in production, and a smoother experience for users.

### Tools to Use
* GitHub Actions: Automates workflows for building, testing, and deploying code directly from your GitHub repository.

* Docker: Creates consistent environments for development, testing, and deployment using containers.

* Docker Compose: Helps manage multi-container setups like web servers, databases, and background jobs.

* AWS/GCP/Heroku: Cloud platforms to host and scale the application with integrated CI/CD support.
